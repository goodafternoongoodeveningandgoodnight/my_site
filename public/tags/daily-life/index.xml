      <description>The first round at UG7 I started as an idiot today. I replied to Jeff that I can find his office UG7 the day before the meeting. But I was totally lost in St Mary&amp;rsquo;s hospital. I left the Green Circle  (the medical campus) and decided not to ask the receptionist where the UG7 is as he was on the call. Then I entred into the Cambridge building, and a nice guy unsure of the UG7 transferred me to the main hospital building.</description>
